          2017 was the year everything get started. During my study, I worked as
          a student developer with a group of talented future stars in CityU's
          Office of Chief and Information Officer (OCIO) department and
          contributed to the launched of the Universityâ€™s official portal app
          with Fuse Open.
          <span>&nbsp;</span>When I graduated with my Bachelor Degree in
          Electronic Engineer, with the happy experience in OCIO, I decided to
          start my career in the software engineering field, focused on web/app
          development.
